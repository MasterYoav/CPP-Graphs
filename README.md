Topic: Graphs

##  Project Description

This project implements an undirected graph using an **adjacency list**, and includes classical graph algorithms such as:

- **BFS** – Breadth-First Search
- **DFS** – Depth-First Search
- **Dijkstra** – Single-source shortest paths
- **Prim** – Minimum Spanning Tree (greedy)
- **Kruskal** – Minimum Spanning Tree using Union-Find

All code is written in **modern C++ (C++17)** using only **raw arrays and pointers**, without any use of STL containers like `vector`, `queue`, or `set`.

Memory management is done manually using `new` and `delete`, and verified using Valgrind.
